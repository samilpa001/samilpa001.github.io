### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

Lab 8, part 1 was one my favorites because I always wanted to know how an online order was made. Yes I know this isnt necessarily up to par with that, but it does give me a general idea of how its coded. I was able to write functions to calculate the correct order that was made by the consumer.

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 2 was a childhood favorite of mine because growing up I used to play blackjack with family. This one hit a little close to home, but i enjoyed it because I truly got an understanding of how blackjack really worked. I was able to write the functions necessary to give me a precise score that would dictate my victory or loss.

* Lab 1

Lab 1, this lab was a milestone for many of us. It gave us the starting point to our programming careers. I think I speak for others when I say that it was this day that decided wether we wanted to pursue a programming career. Personally I think that this lab was a key one for me as it gave me motivation to study the functions necessary to becoming a good programmer in the near future.
